1. Project Overview
Project Name: AI-Powered Mind Map Dashboard

Description:
Develop a web-based dashboard that allows users to input prompts or upload files, which are then processed by an AI to generate structured content. This content is visualized as an interactive mind map, enabling users to edit, customize, and manage their mind maps effectively.

Key Objectives:

Enable users to generate mind maps from textual prompts or uploaded documents.
Provide an intuitive and interactive interface for creating and editing mind maps.
Integrate AI capabilities to structure content hierarchically.
Ensure scalability, security, and a seamless user experience.

2. Vision and Goals
Vision
To create a seamless and intelligent platform that transforms user inputs into dynamic mind maps, enhancing brainstorming, planning, and knowledge organization through AI-driven insights and interactive design.

Goals
User-Centric Design: Develop an intuitive and responsive UI that caters to both novice and advanced users.
AI Integration: Leverage advanced AI to generate accurate and meaningful mind maps from diverse inputs.
Customization: Allow extensive customization of mind maps, including node editing, styling, and file attachments.
Scalability: Build a robust architecture that can handle increasing user loads and data complexity.
Security: Implement strong security measures to protect user data and AI interactions.
Maintainability: Ensure the codebase is clean, well-documented, and easy to maintain or extend.

3. Features and Functionalities
3.1. User Authentication and Management
User Registration & Login: Secure sign-up and sign-in processes using Firebase Authentication.
Profile Management: Allow users to manage their profiles and settings.
Password Recovery: Enable users to reset forgotten passwords.

3.2. Input Methods
Prompt Input: Text box for users to enter prompts.
File Upload: Support for uploading documents (e.g., PDF, DOCX, TXT).

3.3. AI Integration
Content Generation: Use AI (e.g., OpenAI GPT-4) to process inputs and generate structured content.
API Communication: Securely handle API requests and responses.

3.4. Mind Map Generation
Visualization: Render AI-generated content as an interactive mind map.
Hierarchical Structure: Support for headings, subheadings, and nested nodes.
Customization: Options to style nodes, change colors, fonts, and layouts.

3.5. Editing Capabilities
Inline Editing: Edit node content directly within the mind map.
Add/Remove Nodes: Easily add new nodes or delete existing ones.
Drag and Drop: Reposition nodes through drag-and-drop functionality.
Undo/Redo Functionality: Allow users to revert or reapply changes.

3.6. File Management
Attach Files: Link files to specific nodes or the entire mind map.
Preview Files: Display previews or download links for attached files.
Storage: Securely store and retrieve uploaded files using Firebase Storage.

3.7. Data Persistence
Save and Load: Enable users to save mind maps and retrieve them later using Firebase Firestore.
Versioning: Maintain versions of mind maps for tracking changes.
Export/Import: Allow exporting mind maps in various formats (e.g., PDF, PNG, JSON) and importing existing maps.

3.8. Collaboration (Optional)
Real-Time Editing: Allow multiple users to collaborate on a single mind map simultaneously.
Sharing: Share mind maps with others via links or invitations.

3.9. Notifications and Alerts
Activity Alerts: Notify users about important actions or updates.
Error Handling: Inform users of any errors during processing or saving.

3.10. Settings and Preferences
Theme Selection: Light and dark modes.
Language Support: Multi-language capabilities.
Customization Options: Allow users to set default preferences for mind map styling.
